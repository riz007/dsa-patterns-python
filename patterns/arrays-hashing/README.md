# Arrays & Hashing Pattern

## When to Use

- Fast lookup needed
- Track seen elements
- Count frequency
- Avoid O(n²)

## Core Invariant

The hash map or set must always represent elements processed so far.

## Common Mistakes

- Inserting before checking
- Forgetting duplicates
- Off-by-one indexing

## Time Complexity

Usually O(n)

## Problems

- Two Sum
- Contains Duplicate
- Valid Anagram
