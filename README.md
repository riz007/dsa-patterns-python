# DSA Patterns – Python

This repository contains my **pattern-based practice** for Data Structures & Algorithms using **Python**.

## Goals

- Build strong DSA muscle memory
- Master LeetCode / NeetCode 150 patterns
- Focus on **thinking, invariants, and execution**
- Avoid random problem grinding

## Rules

- One pattern at a time
- Python only
- No copying solutions
- Mistakes are logged and reviewed

## Structure

Each pattern has:

- A README explaining the pattern
- Multiple LeetCode problems
- Clear invariants and complexity notes

## Progress Tracking

See:

- `PROGRESS.md`
- `MISTAKES.md`

This repo is for **learning**, not showing off.
